        <h1>Professional Statement</h1>

        <h2><em>"Driven by curiosity, fueled by passion, and committed to solving challenges with creativity and determination."</em></h2>

        <p>I am a bilingual fourth-year Computer Science student at the University of Ottawa with a strong focus on cybersecurity, networking, and protocol analysis. Through academic coursework and practical projects, I have developed expertise in areas such as penetration testing, network configuration, and secure systems design.</p>

        <p>I am passionate about solving complex cybersecurity challenges, as demonstrated by projects like password-cracking algorithms, keylogger development, and training machine learning models for spam detection with 99% accuracy. With a commitment to continuous learning and a proactive approach to problem-solving, I am eager to contribute to innovative teams dedicated to advancing cybersecurity and protecting digital environments.</p>

        <p>I have been passionate about cybersecurity and technology since I was 13 years old, when I first discovered the fascinating world of ethical hacking and computer systems. What started as a curiosity about how things work quickly grew into a deep commitment to understanding and securing the digital landscape. Over the years, Iâ€™ve honed my skills through hands-on projects, from experimenting with network simulations to solving challenges on platforms like HackTheBox. This early interest has shaped my career aspirations, driving me to continuously learn and stay ahead in this dynamic field.</p>
